## About website

Welcome to my homepage, friend :-). I mostly keep technical notes here. `reisinge` was my first Unix login name back in the late '90s.

## About me

I've been securing, operating and building computer systems and writing [programs](https://github.com/jreisinger). Among other things. Recently my areas of interest technology-wise are Go and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl and Linux. See my [CV](cv) for more details.

> I think people who write programs do have at least a glimmer of extra insight into the nature of God... because creating a program often means that you have to create a small universe. -- Donald Knuth
