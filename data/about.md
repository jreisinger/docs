## About website

Hello and welcome to my homepage :-). I mostly keep technical notes here.

## About me

I dabble in the fields of systems administration, security and programming.
Among other things. I like to (co)create and maintain systems and tools that
are useful to people. Recently my areas of interest technology-wise are Go and
Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl, Linux, networking and security. See
my [CV](notes/cv) for more details.
