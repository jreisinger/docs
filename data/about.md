# About this website

Hello and welcome to my homepage :-). I mostly keep IT related notes here.

# About me

I dabble in the fields of systems administration, security and
[programming](https://github.com/jreisinger). Among other things. These days
my main areas of interest in technology are Go and Kubernetes. Before I
concentrated on Perl, Linux, networking and security. See my
[CV](notes/mngt/cv) for more details.

> The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially
attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically
rewarding, but also because it can be an aestethic experience much like
composing poetry or music. -- Donald Knuth (1968)
