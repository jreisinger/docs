# About website

Hello and welcome to my homepage :-). I mostly keep IT related notes here.

# About me

I dabble in the fields of systems administration, security and programming.
Among other things. I like to (co)create and maintain systems and tools that
are useful to people. Recently my areas of interest technology-wise are Go
and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl, Linux, networking and
security. See my [CV](notes/mngt/cv) for more details.

> The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially
attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically
rewarding, but also because it can be an aestethic experience much like
composing poetry or music. -- Donald Knuth (1968)
