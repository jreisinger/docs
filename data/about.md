## About website

Welcome to my homepage, friend. I mostly keep technical notes here. `reisinge` was my first Unix login name back in the late '90s.

## About me

I try to lay some boardwalks across the tar pits of computing infrastructure :-). I also write [programs](https://github.com/jreisinger). See my [CV](https://reisinge.net/cv) for more details.

> I think people who write programs do have at least a glimmer of extra insight into the nature of God... because creating a program often means that you have to create a small universe. -- Donald Knuth
