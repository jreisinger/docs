Hello and welcome to my homepage :-).

I am interested, among other things, in how to build and manage computing systems. I usually work somewhere at the infrastructure level not too close to the hardware nor to the end user. These days my main focus is Kubernetes, Go and DevOps/SRE stuff. Before I concentrated on Linux, Perl, networking and security. See my [CV](notes/mngt/cv) for more.

You can find some of my code on [github](https://github.com/jreisinger). I've also asked and answered couple of questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1039320/jreisinger). I take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jozrei) from time to time.
