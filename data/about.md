## About website

Welcome to my homepage, friend :-). I mostly keep technical notes here. `reisinge` was my first Unix login name back in the late '90s.

## About me

Among other things, I work with computer systems, including writing [programs](https://github.com/jreisinger). My preferred technologies nowadays are Go and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl and Linux. See my [CV](https://reisinge.net/cv) for more details.

> I think people who write programs do have at least a glimmer of extra insight into the nature of God... because creating a program often means that you have to create a small universe. -- Donald Knuth
