## About website

Hello and welcome to my homepage :-). I mostly keep technical notes here.

## About me

I dabble in the fields of systems administration, computer security and [programming](https://github.com/jreisinger). Among other things. I like to create scripts or programs. I usually work at the infrastructure level. Recently my areas of interest technology-wise are Go and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl and Linux. See my [CV](notes/cv) for more details.
