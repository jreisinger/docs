## About website

Welcome to my homepage, friend. I mostly keep technical notes here. `reisinge` was my first Unix login name back in the late '90s.

## About me

I try to understand and navigate the tar pits of computing :-). Some of my preferred technologies nowadays are Go and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl and Linux. See my [CV](https://reisinge.net/cv) and [links](https://reisinge.net/links) for more.
