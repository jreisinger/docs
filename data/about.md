Hello and welcome to my non-official homepage :-). The official one is [here](https://jreisinger.github.io).

I mostly keep technology related notes here.

I am interested, among other things, in how to build and manage software systems and tools. I usually work somewhere at the infrastructure level. These days my main areas of interest are Go, Kubernetes and DevOps/SRE stuff. Before I concentrated on Perl, Linux, networking and security.
