Hello and welcome to my homepage :-). I mostly keep technical notes here.

## About me

I've been dabbling in the fields of operating, securing and building computer [programs](https://github.com/jreisinger) and systems. Among other things. Recently my areas of interest technology-wise are Go and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl and Linux. See my [CV](cv) for more details.
