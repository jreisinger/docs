## About website

Hello and welcome to my homepage :-). I mostly keep technical notes here.

## About me

I dabble in the fields of systems administration, security and
[programming](https://github.com/jreisinger). Among other things. I like to
(co)create and maintain systems and tools that are useful to people. Recently
my areas of interest technology-wise are Go and Kubernetes. Before I
concentrated on Perl, Linux, networking and security. See my [CV](notes/cv) for
more details.
