Hello and welcome to my homepage :-).

I am interested, among other things, in universal machines that manipulate information under the control of a changeable program. I usually work somewhere at the infrastructure level. These days (the Fourth Age) my main focus is [Kubernetes](notes/k8s), [Go](notes/go) and [DevOps](notes/mngt/devops)/[SRE](notes/mngt/sre#sre-approach). In the Third Age I concentrated on [Linux](notes/linux), [Perl](notes/perl) and [Sysadmin](notes/mngt/sre#sysadmin-approach). Before that I was still into [Linux](notes/linux), [Bash](notes/shell), [networking](notes/net) and [security](notes/sec).

Buy me [stuff](https://amzn.com/w/23WE353M6O53S) if you want to make me happy :-). I take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jozrei) from time to time.
