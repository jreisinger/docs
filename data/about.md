Hello and welcome to my non-official homepage :-). The official one is [here](https://jreisinger.github.io).

I mostly keep technology related notes here.

I am interested, among other things, in how to build and manage computing systems. I usually work somewhere at the infrastructure level. These days my main focus is Kubernetes, Go and DevOps/SRE stuff. Before I concentrated on Linux, Perl, networking and security.

Other web sites built and/or hosted by me
