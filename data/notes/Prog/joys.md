# The Joys of the Craft

After reading a chapter or so from Frederick P. Brooks' Mythical Man-Month I (should) like working in IT for the following reasons:

1. The sheer joy of building things (especially of my own design). It's the same delight as a kid is having in his mud pie. "This delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake."

2. Pleasure of making thinks tha are useful to other *people*.

3. "The fascination of fashioning [utvárať] complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning."

4. The joy of always learning. The problems to solve are usually new in some way and thus I always learn something new (practical, theoretical or both).

5. "The delight of working in such a tractable [poddajný] medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be."

And the mystic experience getting my first computer (Commodore 64) as a kid which I still remember.

NOTE: there is also "The Woes [zármutok] of the Craft" part in the book :-).
