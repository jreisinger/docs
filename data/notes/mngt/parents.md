Respect your parents means:

* honor our parents for whatever good things they gave us (with no need to pretend that their mistakes didn't happen)
* take care of them in their old age to the extent that this is reasonable and possible given your circumstances
* in cases of abusive parents, it may not be safely possible to interact with them, and the best you can do to fulfill your filial obligation is pray for their souls from a distance
