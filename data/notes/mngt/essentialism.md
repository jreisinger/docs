Consider you want to solve the problem of a cluttered wardrobe. The steps:

1) Explore and evaluate

Instead of asking, "Is there a chance I will wear this someday?" you ask more
disciplined questions: "Do I love this?" and "Do I look great in it?" If the
answer is no, it's candidate for elimination.

Equivalent question for your personal or professional life: "Will this activity
or effort make the highest possible contribution towards my goal?"

2) Eliminate

Are you really ready to stuff the "probably should get rid of" pile in a bag and
send it off? You will probably feel the sunk-cost bias hitting you.

In other words, it's not enough to simply determine which activities and efforts
don't make the highest possible contribution; you still have to actively
eliminate them.

3) Execute

If you want your wardrobe stay tidy, you need a regular routine for organising
it. You need one large bag for items you need to throw away and a very small
pile for items you want to keep. You need to know the drop-off location and
hours of your local charity shop. You need to have a scheduled time to go there.

In other words, you need a system to make executing your intentions as
effortless as possible.
