# Where to host

OS and SW can be hosted

* in private DCs
* at [co-location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocation_centre) facilities
* on a cloud platform

or on some combination of these.

Most practical choice (especially for new projects) is a public cloud provider, because:

* no capital expenses, low initial operating costs
* no need to install, secure, and manage HW
* on-demand adjustment of storage, bandwidth, and compute capacity
* ready-made solutions for common ancillary needs such as DBs, LBs, queues, monitoring and more
* cheaper and simpler implementation highly available/redundant systems
