Q: Is it better to specialize in a programming language or is it better to
focus on generic problem solving skills like algorithms and design.

A: Both and more. You need to be really good at some language to be able to
implement a solution. Ideally you should be good at multiple languages because
each is better for different use case and each makes you think in different
way. You also need to have some domain specific knowledge like IT security or
system administration.
