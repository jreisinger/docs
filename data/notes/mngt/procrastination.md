There are countless things you could do, so you must not do some of them. Instead of the thing you (or someone else) think you should be working on, you can be doing a) nothing (useful) b) something less important c) something more important.

We don't want type a) and b) procrastination.

What's the best/most important thing you could be working on, and why aren't you? Because:

* you don't enjoy it
* it's a big thing and it's difficult to work on big things

Solution:

* let delight pull you, instead of a check list push you
* work on small things first
* split moral load with others
