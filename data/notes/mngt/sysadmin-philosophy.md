System administration philosophy of Æ. Frish (2002)

* Know how things work.
* Plan it before you do it.
* Make it reversible (backups help a lot with this one).
* Make changes incrementally.
* Test, test, test, before you unleash it on the world.

Tenets of Evi Németh from ULSAH 5th (2017)

* Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive.
