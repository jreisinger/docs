Main points from [ch2](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html) of The Cathedral and the Bazaar.

1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. "Plan to throw one away, you will anyhow." (Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11)
The point isn't merely that you should expect first attempt to be wrong, it's that starting over with the right idea is usually more effective than trying to salvage a mess.
5. If you have the righ attitude, interesting problems will find you.
6. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
