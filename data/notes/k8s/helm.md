Helm is the package manager for the Kubernetes "operating system".

In Helm's vocabulary, a package is called a *chart*. It contains:

* Chart.yaml - describes the chart (name, description, version, author)
* templates - K8s manifests with templating directives
* values.yaml - default configuration
