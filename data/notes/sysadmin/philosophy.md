System administration philosophy of Ã†. Frish (2002)

* Know how things work.
* Plan it before you do it.
* Make it reversible (backups help a lot with this one).
* Make changes incrementally.
* Test, test, test, before you unleash it on the world.

Tenets of Evi Nemeth (from ULSAH 5th, 2017)

* Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive.
  (Postel's law)
* Be liberal in who you hire, but fire early.
* Don't use weasel words.
  [Language designed to sound like something without actually saying anything.]
* Undergraduates are the secret superpower.
* You can never use too much red ink.
* You don't really understand something until you've implemented it.
* It's always time for sushi.
* Be willing to try something twice.
* Always use `sudo`.
