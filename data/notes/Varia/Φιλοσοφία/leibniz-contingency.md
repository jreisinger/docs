[Leibniz](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/)'s Contingency [2] Argument

1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in necessity of its nature (necessary stuff, e.g. numbers) or in an external cause (contingent stuff, e.g. man).
2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence that explanation is God [2].
3. The universe exists.
4. The explanation of the universe's existence is God.

[1] contingent - závislý, podmienený

[2] God = the extremely powerful, uncaused, necessarily existing, non contingent, non-physical, immaterial, eternal being who created the entire universe and everything in it.
