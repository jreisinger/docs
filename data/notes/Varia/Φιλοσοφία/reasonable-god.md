It looks like it's not possible to prove the God's existence using the [scientific method](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/the-pillars-of-science/). Is it then reasonable to think that God exists? Or is it just blind faith without any evidence?

[Fields of study](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/theology-less-speculative-than-quantum-gravity/) by the strength of evidence they can provide *on average*:

```
Math & Logic > Science > History > Most Philosophy
```

However:

* some philosophical arguments are very strong (e.g. if you don't believe the philosophical arguments that we can learn things about the external world based on observation, you can't have any grounds for believing in Science either)
* math proofs are supposed to be completely certain, but if they are thounsands of lines long it is easy for errors to sneak in

# Historical arguments

Sources of evidence

* Testimonies (close history)
* Written documents
* Archeological findings

For

* A. Wall: [Comparing Religions V: Historical Accounts](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/comparing-religions-v-historical-accounts/)
* A. Wall: [Comparing Religions VI: Early Sources](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/comparing-religions-vi-early-sources/)
* A. Wall: [Some comments on Biblical History](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/some-comments-on-biblical-history/)

Against

* Bible is not historical, i.e. it can't be believed.

# Philosophical arguments

For

* Existence of objective universal morality or decent behaviour or fair play (Lewis).
* [Kalam cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument)
* [Leibniz's argument for the existence of God](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/videos/interviews-panels/leibnizs-argument-for-the-existence-of-god-bobby-conway/)

Against

* [Euthypro dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma) <=> Objective universal morality.
* Argument from the evil - an omnipotent and benevolent God should have eliminated all suffering. We observe plenty of man made and natural suffering in the world. <=> Free will can not be achieved without allowing the possibility of doing wrong things. What about suffering not cause by people (like tsunami)?

# Personal experience

> Why should they be impartial, what is being impartial, when the whole world is at war about whether one thing is a devouring superstition or a divine hope? I do not pretend to be impartial in the sense that the final act of faith fixes a man's mind because it satisfies his mind. But I do profess to be a great deal more impartial than they are; in the sense that I can tell the story fairly, with some sort of imaginative justice to all sides; and they cannot.  (The Everlasting Man)
