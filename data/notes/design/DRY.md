DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself

* the only way to develop SW that is reliable, easy to understand and maintain
* every piece of *knowledge* must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system

The alternative

* the same thing is expressed in two or more places
* if you change one, you have to remember to change the others
* it isn't a question of whether you'll remember: it's a question of when you'll forget

DRY concerns

* code
* documentation - don't describe what the code does in comments
* data
* developers - encourage active and frequent communitcation (stand ups, Slack channels, code reviews)
