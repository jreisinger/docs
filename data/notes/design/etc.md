ETC = Easy To Change

* the essence of good design
* every design principle out there is a special case of ETC
* a thing is well designed if it adapts to people who use it
* code must adapt by changing

ETC is a *value*, not a rule

* a guide helping you to choose between paths
* just like other values, it should be floating just behing your conscious though, subtly nudging you in the right direction
* How to make that happen? Spend a week deliberately asking yourself "did the thing I just did make the overall system easier or harder to change?".
