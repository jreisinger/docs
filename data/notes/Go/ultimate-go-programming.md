* mechanics - how things work
* semantics - how things behave

Philosophy

1. Make it correct.
2. Make it clear and readible.
3. Make it fast.

In that order.

> Simple, straightforward code is just plain easier to work with and less likely to have problems. As programs get bigger and more complicated, it's even more important to have clean, simple code. -- Brian Kernighan

> The correctness of the implementation is the most important concern, but there is no royal road to correctness. It involves diverse tasks such as thinking of invariants, testing and code reviews. Optimization should be done, but not prematurely. -- Al Aho (inventor of AWK)
