# Top-Down Design

Sometimes called step-wise refinement:

1. Express the algorithm as a series of smaller problems.
2. Develop an interface (function name, parameters and return values) for each of the smaller problems.
3. Detail the algorithm by expressing it in terms if its interfaces with the smaller problems.
4. Repeat the process for each smaller problem.
