# DDoS attacks

## Amplification attacks

* a small query can trigger a large response
* this query is 48 bytes (seen in Wireshark) and the response is 3390 bytes

```
$ dig @ns1.isc.org. any isc.org. +norec +dnssec | grep -i size
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 3390
```

* so a bot with 1Mbps connection can make a DNS server to generate cca 70Mb each second (3390/48)
* a botnet with 15 such bots can make the DNS server saturate a 1Gbps network (15*70)

## Reflection attacks

* queries with spoofed (victim's) source IP address
* the victim will get unsollicited (often amplified) responses

## Combination attacks

* spoofed source IP address + query that will result in a large payload
* authoritative server provides the amplification, recursive server provides the reflection

# Cache poisoning

<img src="/static/cache-poisoning.jpeg" style="max-width:100%;width:320px">

1. The attacker has prior knowledge of the target domain and sends a query to the recursive DNS server for a name that does not exist, such as q0001xxx.example.com
2. Because this is a name that does not exist, the recursive DNS server must traverse the DNS namespace to find it.
3. The attacker can beat the legitimate NXDOMAIN response from the authoritative name server, by sending a lot of spoofed responses that look like they are coming from the legitimate example.com authoritative name server. In the spoofed response, attacker claims www.example.com is the NS record of the domain, to trick the recursive name server into accepting www.example.com and its IP address.
4. By the laws of probability, the attackerâ€™s spoofed response may be accepted by the recursive server, and the bad answer www.example.com is now stored in its cache.
5. Unsuspecting client queries for the name www.example.com A record.
6. The recursive server provides the answer from the now-poisoned cache with the forged answer from the attacker.
