> Securing DevOps (2018)

Continuos security

* DevOps (and [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and [Deming](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points)) focuses on shipping better products to *customers* faster
* many security teams focus on compliance with a security standard, number of security incidents and vulnerabilities on production systems
* both are valid but different goals; this creates conflict and hurts the organization
* solution => "continuos security" (or SecDevOps): allign goals by switching focus of security team from defending only the infrastructure to protecting the entire organization by improving it continuously
* techniques from traditional security, such as vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection, and log monitoring, should be reused and adapted to fit in the DevOps pipeline

* (1) TDS - security testing should be handled the same way application tests are handled in the CI and CD pipelines: automatically and all the time
* (2) Monitoring and responding to attacks - 2nd phase of continuous security; fraud and intrusion detection, digital forensics, and incident response
* (3) Assessing risks and maturing security - go beyond the technology and look at the organizationâ€™s security posture from a high altitude; risk management
