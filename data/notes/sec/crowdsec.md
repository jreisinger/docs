Business model

> To achieve our goal, we decided to give everything for free to our community users and make businesses that wouldn’t (or often couldn’t) share IPs they blocked with us, be the ones paying to get access to our high-quality IP block lists. They would also get granted with tailor-made enterprise features specifically designed for them. -- https://crowdsec.net/culture/
