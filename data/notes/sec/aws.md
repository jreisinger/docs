# Security Design Principles

Implement strong identity foundation

* implement least privilege and separation of duties
* centralize IAM
* aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials

Enable traceability

* monitor, alert and audit actions and changes to you environment in real time
* integrate log and metric collection with systems

Apply security at all layers

* implement defense in depth with multiple security controls
* e.g. at network edge, VPC, load balancing, every instance, OS, application and code level

Automate security best practices

* create secure architectures
* define and manage security controls as code in version-controlled templates

Protect data in transit and at rest

* classify data into sensitivity levels
* use encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate

Keep people away from data

* reduce or eliminate need for direct access or manual processing of data

Prepare for security events

* have incident management and investigation policy and process that align to your organizational requirements
* use tools and automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery
* run incident response simulations
