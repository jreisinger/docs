TICK stack is a collection of open source components for easy storing, visualization and monitoring of time series data such as metrics and events

* Telegraf - serve agent for collecting and reporting metrics
* InfluxDB - high-performance time series database
* Chronograf - GUI
* Kapacitor - data-processing engine that can (stream, batch) process data from InfluxDB

Unlike Prometheus, which is based on the pull model (scraping), TICK stack is based on the push model of collecting data.
