Principles

* effortful learning is deeper and more durable but might feel less productive
* all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge (e.g. you need to remember algebra and geometry before you can learn trigonometry)
* when you do mechanical repeating you quickly hit the limit of what you can keep in your mind
* when you practice elaboration [1] there are not known limits

Practical hints

* do periodic spaced out (getting little rusty) practice of two or more different but related topics in interleaved (not sequenced) fashion
* recall facts and concepts from memory over re-reading and single-minded rapid repetition (mass practice)
* try to solve a problem (often with errors) before being taught the solution
* use different learning styles (e.g. auditory vs visual)
* use testing to identify weaknesses
* make mistakes and correct them

[1] elaboration = expressing new material in your own words and connecting it with what you already know
