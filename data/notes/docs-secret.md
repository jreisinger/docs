* allows newcomer to get started
* is a lesson

Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook

## How-to guide

* shows how to solve a specific problem
* is a series of steps

Analogy: a recipe in a cookery book

## Explanation

* is understanding-oriented
* explains
* provides background and context

## Reference

* describes the machinery
* is accurate and complete
