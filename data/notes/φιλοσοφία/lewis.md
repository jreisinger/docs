A schoolboy replied that, as far as he could make out, God was "The sort of person who is always snooping round to see if anyone is enjoying himself and then trying to stop it." :-)

In reality, moral rules are directions for running the human machine.

Morality is concerned with:

2. Tidiness or harmony inside each individual. 
3. The general purpose of human life as a whole (what course the whole fleet ought to be on?).
