## The three parts of morality

A schoolboy replied that, as far as he could make out, God was "The sort of person who is always snooping round to see if anyone is enjoying himself and then trying to stop it." :-)

In reality, moral rules are directions for running the human machine.

Morality is concerned with:

1. Fair play and harmony between individuals.
2. Tidiness or harmony inside each individual. 
3. The general purpose of human life as a whole (what course the whole fleet ought to be on?).

Does it not make a great difference whether I am, so to speak, the landlord of my own mind and body, or only a tenant, responsible to the real landlord?

Now there are a good many things which would not be worth bothering about if I were going to live only seventy years, but which I had better bother about very seriously if I am going to live for ever:

* my character
* importance of an individual (democracy) vs society/nation/state (totalitarianism)

## The "cardinal virtues"

* cardinal comes from Latin and it means "the hinge of a door"

PRUDENCE (rozvaznost)

* practical common sense
* taking the trouble to think out what you are doing and what is likely to come of it

TEMPERANCE (striedmost)

* going the right length and not further

JUSTICE (spravodlivost)

* fairness
* honesty, give and take, truthfulness, keeping promises, ...

FORTITUDE (statocnost)

* courage facing dangers
* courage facing pain

A man who perseveres in doing just actions gets in the end a certain quality of character (like a good tennis player). Now it is that quality rather than the particular actions which we mean when we talk of "virtue."
