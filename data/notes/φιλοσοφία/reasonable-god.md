It looks like it's not possible to prove the God's existence using the [scientific method](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/the-pillars-of-science/). Is it still reasonable to think that God exists?

Fields of study by the strength of evidence they can provide on average:

```
Math & Logic > Science > History > Most Philosophy
```

NOTE: The existence of God does not, of course, depend on any particular person's ability to effectively argue for (or against) him. -- [Aron Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/thoughts-on-the-carroll-craig-debate/)

# Reasonable people who believe that God exists

* [C.S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis) (1898 - 1963) - English literature (Oxford)
* [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) (1938) - computer scientist (Stanford)
* [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) (1954) - language designer
* [Edward Feser](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/) (1968) - philosopher
* [Aron Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/bio/) - theoretical physicist (Cambridge)
* [Luke Barnes](https://www.closertotruth.com/contributor/luke-barnes/profile) - theoretical physicist (Australia)

# Reasonable atheists

* [Richard P. Feynman](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/what-about-science/) - physicist

# Philosofical arguments

For

* Existence of objective universal morality or decent behaviour or fair play (Lewis).
* [Kalam cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument)
* [Leibniz's argument for the existence of God](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/videos/interviews-panels/leibnizs-argument-for-the-existence-of-god-bobby-conway/)

Against

* [Euthypro dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma) <=> Objective universal morality.
* Argument from the evil - an omnipotent and benevolent God should have eliminated all suffering. We observe plenty of man made and natural suffering in the world. <=> Free will can not be achieved without allowing the possibility of doing wrong things. What about suffering not cause by people (like tsunami)?

# Historical arguments

For

* search [Aron's blog](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/)

Against

* Bible is not historical, i.e. it can't be believed.
