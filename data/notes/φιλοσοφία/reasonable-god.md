It looks like it's not possible to prove the God's existence using the [scientific method](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/the-pillars-of-science/). Is it then reasonable to think that God exists?

Fields of study by the strength of evidence they can provide on average:

```
Math & Logic > Science > History > Most Philosophy
```

# Historical 

Sources of evidence

* Written documents
* Archeological findings

For

* search [Aron's blog](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/)

Against

* Bible is not historical, i.e. it can't be believed.

# Philosophical arguments

For

* Existence of objective universal morality or decent behaviour or fair play (Lewis).
* [Kalam cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument)
* [Leibniz's argument for the existence of God](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/videos/interviews-panels/leibnizs-argument-for-the-existence-of-god-bobby-conway/)

Against

* [Euthypro dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma) <=> Objective universal morality.
* Argument from the evil - an omnipotent and benevolent God should have eliminated all suffering. We observe plenty of man made and natural suffering in the world. <=> Free will can not be achieved without allowing the possibility of doing wrong things. What about suffering not cause by people (like tsunami)?

# Bias

> Why should they be impartial, what is being impartial, when the whole world is at war about whether one thing is a devouring superstition or a divine hope? I do not pretend to be impartial in the sense that the final act of faith fixes a man's mind because it satisfies his mind. But I do profess to be a great deal more impartial than they are; in the sense that I can tell the story fairly, with some sort of imaginative justice to all sides; and they cannot.  (The Everlasting Man)

NOTE about debates: The existence of God does not, of course, depend on any particular person's ability to effectively argue for (or against) him. -- [Aron Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/thoughts-on-the-carroll-craig-debate/)
