Anyone can contribute to [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/). It is also pretty huge. This means you might want to separate the wheat from the chaff. To do that these hints might help:

1. What's the code **activity**? The more the better.

2. How many **issues** do we have? The open bugs show community involvement, the closed ones are about the maintainer's diligence.

3. What aboout the quality and quantity of **tests** and their results.

4. Are there any reverse **dependencies** (they use the same basic principle as Google PageRank)? The more the better.

5. Follow the **advice of experts** in the Perl field, ex. [Task::Kensho](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Kensho).

NOTE: don't check any of the hints above in isolation but all/more of them together.
