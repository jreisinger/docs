# Basic logic

* common sense logic
* Aristotelian logic

## Syllogism

basic form of deductive argument, e.g.:

1. Major proposition: "Rational animals are mortal."
2. Minor proposition: "Socrates is a rational animal."
3. Conclusion: "Therefore Socrates is mortal."

Syllogism connects the subject ("Socrates") and predicate ("mortal") terms of
its conclusion through its middle term ("rational animal") in its two
propositions. The first of which states a general principle and the second
brings a particular case under that principle. The conclusion then demonstrates
the result of applying the general principle to the particular case.

## Logical expressions

Term (understanding): the subject or predicate of a proposition, expressing a
concept

* clear (unambiguous)
* unclear (ambiguous)

Proposition (judging): declarative sentence, affirmative or negative

* true
    * evident
        * self-evident
            * in itself and to us
            * in itself but not to us
        * through other propositions
            * deductively - from a general principle to an instance of it
            * inductively - from individual cases to general principles
    * not evident
* false

Argument (reasoning): a proof that a certain proposition is true by showing that
it follows (logically and necessarily) from other propositions being true

* logically valid
* logically invalid

Subject - the term in a proposition about which something is said in the
predicate

Predicate - term that says something about the subject
