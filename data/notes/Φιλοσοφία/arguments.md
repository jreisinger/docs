It's not possible to prove (or disprove) the God's existence using the [modern scientific method](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/the-pillars-of-science/). This is because God, if exists, is not an object among other objects or a force among other forces. It's something very different and external to the observable world. Is it then reasonable to think that God exists? Are there some reasons or arguments for God's existence? (These arguments can be classified into historical, cosmological, psychological ... But here I am more interested to find the ones that I can understand and that make most sense to me.)

# Historicity of Jesus

If God is unreal, Jesus was history's biggest fool or fake. -- Peter Kreeft: A Shorter Summa (1993)

"Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed." -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)

Robert M. Price (a Christian atheist) who denies the existence of Jesus agrees that this perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)

Michael Grant, a classicist, states: "In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus,' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary." -- [Jesus](https://books.google.sk/books?id=zVUxICZlgYIC&redir_esc=y) (2004)

Bart Ehrman (a secular agnostic) wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" -- [Forged](https://books.google.sk/books?id=hFNBDTS5HY0C&lpg=PP1) (2011), p. 285

# Notes on the study of history

Sources of evidence

* Written documents
* Archeological findings
* Testimonies (only close history)

... doing ancient history is HARD! Just as in Science, the different types of data don't always agree very well, and we have to put things together the best we can. -- [A. Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/some-comments-on-biblical-history/)

Heck, cosmology is a more rigorous subject than archaeology, and there, until recently, we had this problem where many galaxies seemed to be older than the universe. -- [A. Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/some-comments-on-biblical-history/)

Bart Ehrman: "Serious historians of the early Christian movement‚Äîall of them‚Äîhave spent many years preparing to be experts in their field. Just to read the ancient sources requires expertise in a range of ancient languages: Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and often Aramaic, Syriac, and Coptic, not to mention the modern languages of scholarship (for example, German and French). And that is just for starters. Expertise requires years of patiently examining ancient texts and a thorough grounding in the history and culture of Greek and Roman antiquity, the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, both pagan and Jewish, knowledge of the history of the Christian church and the development of its social life and theology, and, well, lots of other things. It is striking that virtually everyone who has spent all the years needed to attain these qualifications is convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical figure." --  [Did Jesus Exist?](https://www.amazon.com/Did-Jesus-Exist-Historical-Argument/dp/0062206443) (2012), p. 4 - 5

# Philosophical arguments

Against

* Argument from the evil - an omnipotent, benevolent and infinite God should have eliminated all suffering. We observe plenty of man made and natural suffering in the world.   
  * Free will can not be achieved without allowing the possibility of doing wrong things.
  * God can bring good through suffering - we can't always (most of the time) see how.

For

* ‚ÄúThe most incomprehensible thing about the Universe is that it is comprehensible.‚Äù -- A. Einstein
* Existence of objective universal morality or decent behaviour or fair play -> C. S. Lewis: Mere Christinanity - Book I
