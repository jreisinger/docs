These are the notes about the book A Shorter Summa by Peter Kreeft (1993).

# Preface

* the Summa is the greatest, most ambitious, most rational book of theology ever
  written
* it contains much philosophy
* not to know St. Thomas means ignoring the most important intellectual
  development between 384 B.C. (the death of Aristotle) and 1637 A.D. (the
  publication of Descartes' Discourse on Method)

# Introduction

## On St. Thomas

One of the greatest philosophers who ever lived, for at least eight reasons:

1. He tells the truth.
2. Common sense - St. Thomas is plain and reasonable as your uncle.
3. Practicality (dish of herring).
4. Clarity. Those who love truth passionately usually also love simplicity and
   clarity of style so that as many people as possible can benefit from this
   precious thing, Truth.
5. Profundity. No philosopher since St. Thomas has ever so successfully combined
   the two fundamental ideals of philosophical writing: clarity and profundity.
6. Orthodoxy.
7. Medievalism and modernity (8.). Marriage of faith and reason, revelation and
   philosophy, the Biblical and the classical inheritances. Aquinas stands as a
   shining example of an alternative to both the fundamentalists and the
   liberals of his day and of any day.

Of course St. Thomas cannot be the be-all and end-all of our thought. He cannot
be an end, but he can be a beginning, like Socrates. There is no better bottom
story to our edifice of thought.

## On the Summa Theologica

* a Summa is simply a summary (many philosophers and theologians of the time
  wrote Summas)
* it's more like an encyclopedia than a textbook
* there is extreme economy in the use of words (should appeal to us busy moderns)
* medievals had passion for order
* a summarized debate (shared journey to discovery)
* St. Thomas believed not only that there was all truth Somewhere but also that
  there was some truth everywhere

Summa Theologica mirrors the structural outline of reality:
