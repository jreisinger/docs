It's not possible to prove (or disprove) the God's existence using the [modern scientific method](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/the-pillars-of-science/). This is because God, if exists, is not an object among other objects or a force among other forces. It's something totally different and external to the observable world. Is it then reasonable to think that God exists? Are there some arguments or reasons for God's existence?

1. Historical arguments
2. Philosophical arguments
3. Reasonable theists
4. ~~Blind~~ faith

# Historical reasons

Sources of evidence

* Written documents
* Archeological findings
* Testimonies (only close history)

What this shows is that doing ancient history is HARD!  Just as in Science, the different types of data don't always agree very well, and we have to put things together the best we can. -- [A. Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/some-comments-on-biblical-history/)

Heck, cosmology is a more rigorous subject than archaeology, and there, until recently, we had this problem where many galaxies seemed to be older than the universe. -- [A. Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/some-comments-on-biblical-history/)

## Historicity of Jesus

"Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed." -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)

Michael Grant, a classicist, states: "In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus,' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary." -- Jesus (2004)

Robert M. Price (a Christian atheist) who denies the existence of Jesus agrees that this perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)

Bart Ehrman (a secular agnostic) wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" -- Forged: writing in the name of God ISBN (2011), p. 285

Bart Ehrman: "Serious historians of the early Christian movement—all of them—have spent many years preparing to be experts in their field. Just to read the ancient sources requires expertise in a range of ancient languages: Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and often Aramaic, Syriac, and Coptic, not to mention the modern languages of scholarship (for example, German and French). And that is just for starters. Expertise requires years of patiently examining ancient texts and a thorough grounding in the history and culture of Greek and Roman antiquity, the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, both pagan and Jewish, knowledge of the history of the Christian church and the development of its social life and theology, and, well, lots of other things. It is striking that virtually everyone who has spent all the years needed to attain these qualifications is convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical figure." --  Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth (2012), p. 4 - 5

## Historicity of the Bible

Jesus in the Gospels often quotes the Old testament obviously considering it true.

# Philosophical reasons

For

* “The most incomprehensible thing about the Universe is that it is comprehensible.” -- A. Einstein
* Existence of objective universal morality or decent behaviour or fair play -> C. S. Lewis: Mere Christinanity - Book I
* [Argument from motion](https://youtu.be/bdjjqFSEJ_Y) from the Five ways of Aquinas
* [Kalam cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument)
* [Leibniz's contingency argument](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/videos/interviews-panels/leibnizs-argument-for-the-existence-of-god-bobby-conway/)
* [Argument from desire](https://youtu.be/X71Gq9a1qxE)

Against

* Argument from the evil - an omnipotent and benevolent God should have eliminated all suffering. We observe plenty of man made and natural suffering in the world.   
  * Free will can not be achieved without allowing the possibility of doing wrong things.
  * God can bring good through suffering - we can't always (most of the time) see how.

# Faith

[In the sense](https://youtu.be/m_4PSgFjtvI) that it's something that comes at the far edge of reason. Like when you know a person for a long time and then he tells you something you can't verify. You have to decide whether you believe him or not.

> Why should they be impartial, what is being impartial, when the whole world is at war about whether one thing is a devouring superstition or a divine hope? I do not pretend to be impartial in the sense that the final act of faith fixes a man's mind because it satisfies his mind. But I do profess to be a great deal more impartial than they are; in the sense that I can tell the story fairly, with some sort of imaginative justice to all sides; and they cannot. -- Chesterton: [The Everlasting Man](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100311.txt)
