These are notes from the book A Shorter Summa by Peter Kreeft (1993).

# Preface

* the Summa is the greatest, most ambitious, most rational book of theology ever
  written
* it contains much philosophy
* not to know St. Thomas means ignoring the most important intellectual
  development between 384 B.C. (the death of Aristotle) and 1637 A.D. (the
  publication of Descartes' Discourse on Method)

# Introduction

## On St. Thomas

One of the greatest philosophers who ever lived, for at least eight reasons:

1. He tells the truth.
2. Common sense - St. Thomas is plain and reasonable as your uncle.
3. Practicality (dish of herring).
4. Clarity. Those who love truth passionately usually also love simplicity and
   clarity of style so that as many people as possible can benefit from this
   precious thing, Truth.
5. Profundity. No philosopher since St. Thomas has ever so successfully combined
   the two fundamental ideals of philosophical writing: clarity and profundity.
6. Orthodoxy [authorized or generally accepted theory]. St. Thomas it the primary theological Doctor (Teacher) of the
   Catholic Church. You can never understand philosophy from its critics or
   dissenters, only from a disciple.
7. Marriage of faith and reason, revelation and philosophy, the Biblical and the
   classical inheritances. Aquinas stands as a shining example of an alternative
   to both the fundamentalists and the liberals of his day and of any day. For a
   brief moment it seemed that a synthesis was possible.
8. St. Thomas is important for us today precisely because of our lack.

Of course St. Thomas cannot be the be-all and end-all of our thought. He cannot
be an end, but he can be a beginning, like Socrates. There is no better bottom
story to our edifice of thought.

## On the Summa Theologica

* a Summa is simply a summary (many philosophers and theologians of the time
  wrote Summas)
* it's more like an encyclopedia than a textbook
* there is extreme economy in the use of words (should appeal to us busy moderns)
* medievals had passion for order
* a summarized debate (shared journey to discovery)
* St. Thomas believed not only that there was all truth Somewhere but also that
  there was some truth everywhere

Summa Theologica mirrors the structural outline of reality: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1047259/147875253-1f32ecf9-3438-479b-8f77-f7a6924ab05a.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto">

The "Article" is the basic thought-unit and it has five structural parts:

1. A question in a yes or no format.
2. Objections (usually three) to the answer he will give.
3. His own position ("On the contrary ...").
4. The body of the Article ("I answer that ...").
5. Answer to each objection.

If our question is vaguely or confusedly formulated, our answer will be, too. If
we do not seriously consider opposing views, we spar without a partner and paw
the air. If we do not do our homework, we only skim the shallows of our selves.
If we do not prove our thesis, we are dogmatic, not critical. And if we do not
understand and refute our opponents, we are left with nagging uncertainty that
we have missed something and not really ended the contest.

Like Socratic dialogue with Plato, this medieval method of philosophizing was
very fruitful in its own day - and then got neglected, especially in our day.
That is one of the unsolved mysteries of Western thought. Perhaps what stands in
the way is our craze [sialenstvo] for originality and our proud refusal to be
anyone's apprentice.

St. Thomas chops his prose bite-sized segments for the same reason Mommy cuts
Baby's meat into bite-sized chunks.

The best preparation for reading the Summa is a review of basic, common sense
logic, i.e., Aristotelian logic, especially the "Three Acts of the Mind", as the
medievals labeled them: understanding, judging and reasoning, with their
respective logical expressions: terms, propositions, and arguments.
