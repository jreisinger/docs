# Run shell commands in parallel

## Why and how is it useful

I'm using shell (bash specifically) on daily basis. From time to time a need arised to run multiple commands in parallel. For example my [.bashrc](https://github.com/jreisinger/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc) runs the following commands to download or clone vim plugins I use:

```
curl -L -o $HOME/.git-completion.bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
#curl -L -o $HOME/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/nerdtree && git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/nerdtree
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-nerdtree-tabs && git clone https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-nerdtree-tabs
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-markdown && git clone https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-markdown
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/bufexplorer && git clone https://github.com/jlanzarotta/bufexplorer.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/bufexplorer
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/ansible-vim && git clone https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/ansible-vim
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go && git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/grep.vim && git clone https://github.com/yegappan/grep.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/grep.vim
# https://tpaschalis.github.io/vim-go-setup/
rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-airline && git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-airline
```

The problem is that these commmands run sequentially and it takes a while until they are done. I was thinking of a way how to speed them up. So to scratch my itch a came up with [runp](https://github.com/jreisinger/runp). Now I can run those commands (I stored them in `install-my-stuff.txt`) in parallel:

<script id="asciicast-UHUNnf3U2Kf0v5FQrz4j5wOJ6" src="https://asciinema.org/a/UHUNnf3U2Kf0v5FQrz4j5wOJ6.js" async></script>

Let's see how much time did I save:

```
$ time bash install-my-stuff.txt
<...>
real	0m15.690s
user	0m3.440s
sys	0m0.902s

$ time runp install-my-stuff.txt
<...>
real	0m3.678s
user	0m3.904s
sys	0m0.880s
```

Hmm, aroud 12 seconds. Not bad I think :-). Especially if you run it often.

Additionally you get a simple "progress bar" (the `-->` is moving) and some information about each command. It looks like this:

```
--> <status> (<elapsed_time>): <command>
```

and it's send to STDERR (so you can redirect it via `2>` shell construct).

If you don't want `runp` to add any additional output use the `-q` (quiet) flag:

```
$ runp -q install-my-stuff.txt 
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 70071  100 70071    0     0   145k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  145k

# How to install it

If you want to try it out you can easily install it. It's a single binary that you download and make it executable.

```
# choose your system and architecture
export SYS=linux  # or darwin
export ARCH=amd64 # or arm

# download it an make it executable
curl -L https://github.com/jreisinger/runp/releases/latest/download/runp-$SYS-$ARCH -o ~/bin/runp
chmod u+x ~/bin/runp
```

# More examples

The commands to execute can be supplied also via stdin. It means that `runp` can be used within pipes like this one:

```
$ for dir in $HOME /etc /tmp; do echo sudo "du -sh $dir"; done | runp -q | sort -h
13M	/tmp
17M	/etc
370G	/home/reisinge
```

Here we generate the commands to run in a bash for loop. Then we pipe the commands into `runp`. Finally the `runp`'s output (stdout) is sorted.

We can simplify by using the `-p` flag which adds a prefix string to the final command that will be run:

```
$ echo -e "$HOME\n/etc\n/tmp" | runp -q -p 'sudo du -sh' | sort -h
13M	/tmp
17M	/etc
370G	/home/reisinge
```

The final example shows how to find open ports from a list of hosts and ports:

```
# file with host-port pairs
$ cat host-port.txt
localhost 80
localhost 81
127.0.0.1 443
127.0.0.1 444
localhost 22

# find out which ports are listening
$ cat host-port.txt | runp -p 'netcat -v -w2 -z' -q 2>&1 | egrep 'open$'
localhost [127.0.0.1] 443 (https) open
localhost [127.0.0.1] 80 (http) open
localhost [127.0.0.1] 22 (ssh) open
```
