# My cybersecurity career evaluation

I read Daniel Miessler's [article](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/) and liked it. So I tried to evaluate myself against it.

* ✅ come from one of these backgrounds
    * system administration 👈
    * networking
    * development
* ✅ have a good foundation in all these and a decent strength in one
    * networking (TCP/IP, switching, routing, protocols, ...)
    * system administration (Windows/Linux, AD, hardening, ...)
    * programming (concepts, scripting, OOP basics) 👈
* ✅ have some relevant certifications (CCNA, CISSP, LPIC-2, CCENT, CKAD)
* ✅ nurture your programming skills; you can build websites, tools, PoCs, ...
* ✅ stay up to date (twitter, RSS, ...)
* ✅ have a lab (AWS + home server)
* ✅ be always working on ([GitHub](https://github.com/jreisinger/)) projects
* ✅ make contributions (on GitHub)
* 🚫 practice with bug bounties (BugCrowd, HackerOne)
* ✅ have a presence ([web site](https://reisinge.net), [blog](https://reisinge.net/blog), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JozefReisinger))
* ✅ network with others (interact on Twitter, go to conferences, ...)
* 🚫 respond to Call for Papers (CFP)
* ✅ professionalism
    * dependability
    * wardrobe
    * speak concisely
    * tighten up you writing
    * learn to present
* ✅ understand the business
* ✅ have a passion
* ✅ you’re in your 30’s, 40’s, or 50’s, and things are looking good :-)
* 🤏 financial knowledge
* 🤏 management experience (people not only projects)
* 🤏 extensive network (know a good percentage of the major players in infosec and business)
* 🤏 dress/etiquette :-)
* ✅ advanced education
* 🚫 media savvy (trained to speak with the media about various topics)
* 🤏 tech/business hybrid (be able to speak and work with devs and managers)
* 🤏 creativity (able not only execute what you're given but come up with new ideas and approaches to problems on a regular cadence)

Some of the above attributes are applicable only to certain career phases (junior, senior, team lead). Others are universal.
