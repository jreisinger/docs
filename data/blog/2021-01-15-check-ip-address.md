# Checking an IP address

Sometimes I come across an unknown IP address. This happens, for example, when I'm reviewing logs and I see that someone or (most probably) something was trying to SSH into the system. Or it was enumerating the URLs of a web application.

In such scenario I want to have a quick and easy way to check the IP address. I created a command line tools called [checkip](https://github.com/jreisinger/checkip) that does just that.

For example the following IP address definitely looks suspicious:

![checkip](/static/checkip.png)
