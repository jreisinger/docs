Last week I uploaded [App::Monport](http://metacpan.org/pod/App::Monport) to CPAN. I did it to try out the CPAN toolchain and to get a feeling of accomplishment :-). But I also think the application might be useful to some folks.

Update: My application was mentioned in PerlTricks' [article](http://perltricks.com/article/184/2015/8/4/What-s-new-on-CPAN---July-2015). Cool!
