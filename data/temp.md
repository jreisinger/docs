Some of the [quotes](https://quotes.reisinge.net/) I like best ATM :-)

> The programmer, like the poet, works only sligtly removed from the pure thought-stuff. Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. -- Frederick P. Brooks

> Money is like gas in the car - you need to pay attention or you'll end up on the side of the road - but a successful business or a well-lived life is not a tour of gas stations. -- Tim O'Reilly, WTF
