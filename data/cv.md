I have been doing IT stuff for companies of varied sizes and types for **10+ years**. My experience is mainly in **systems administration** (or [SRE](https://reisinge.net/notes/mngt/sre)) and IT **security**. I have touched several infrastructures and done quite some **programming** or scripting. I try to stay on top of new technologies and practices and use them when/where appropriate. I am not bad at **managing** smaller projects and teams.
