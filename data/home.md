Hello and welcome to my non-official homepage :-). The official one is [here](https://jreisinger.github.io/).

I mostly keep (mostly technical) notes here. These days (the Fourth Age) my main focus is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Go](https://golang.org/). In the Third Age I concentrated on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [Perl](https://www.perl.org/).
