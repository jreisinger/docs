Hello and welcome to my non-official homepage :-). The official one is [here](https://jreisinger.github.io/).

I mostly keep (mostly technical) notes here. These days (the Fourth Age) my main focus is [Kubernetes](notes/k8s), [Go](notes/go) and [DevOps](notes/mngt/devops)/[SRE](notes/mngt/sre#sre-approach). In the Third Age I concentrated on [Linux](notes/linux), [Perl](notes/perl) and [Sysadmin](notes/mngt/sre#sysadmin-approach). Before that I was still into [Linux](notes/linux), [Bash](notes/shell), [networking](notes/net) and [security](notes/sec).
