Hello and welcome to my non-official homepage :-). The official one is [here](https://jreisinger.github.io/).

I mostly keep (mostly technical) notes here. These days (the Fourth Age) my main focus is [Kubernetes](notes/k8s), [Go](https://golang.org/) and [DevOps](https://reisinge.net/notes/mngt/devops)/[SRE](https://reisinge.net/notes/mngt/sre#sre-approach). In the Third Age I concentrated on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) and [Sysadmin](https://reisinge.net/notes/mngt/sre#sysadmin-approach). Before that I was into [Linux](https://reisinge.net/notes/linux/), [Bash](https://reisinge.net/notes/shell/) and [security](https://reisinge.net/notes/sec/).
