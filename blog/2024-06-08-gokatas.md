I've been working in the DevOps (sysadmin) and cybersecurity domains. That means I work with computer programs all the time and I have to understand how they work. From time to time I also write programs, like when building tools or automating tasks. But how to learn and remember a programming language if you don't get to program every day?

There's a similar situation in martial arts. You don't want to be discovering and learning fighting techniques (only) in a fight. Martial arts' solution is called kata. It's a set of fighting techniques that are regularly practiced until internalized. [Gokatas](https://github.com/gokatas) is my implementation of this idea for Go programming.

The get started install the gokatas command line tool:

```
go install github.com/gokatas/gokatas@latest
```

One practice cycle has four simple steps:

1. Choose a kata (bcounter in this case) and clone it. By default katas are shown in alphabetical order but you can sort them by number of lines.

```
‚ùØ gokatas -sortby lines
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/gokatas/bcounter.git
‚ùØ cd bcounter
```

2. Read the documentation and code and try to understand it. You can use ChatGPT to help you out.

```
‚ùØ  export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
‚ùØ gokatas -explain bcounter
```

3. Delete (some of) the code and try to write it back. Check how are you doing.

```
‚ùØ git diff
```

4. Track your progress to stay motivated.

```
‚ùØ gokatas -done bcounter -sortby last -report

It's important to practice regularly because repetition creates habits, and habits are what enable mastery. Set a goal that you are able to meet and insert it into your daily routines. Start by taking baby steps. After some time it will require much less will power to practice. Your programming moves will start looking simpler and smoother. ü•ã
