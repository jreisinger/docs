I've been working in the DevOps (sysadmin) and cybersecurity domains. That means I work with computer programs all the time. I have to understand how they work so I can (help other people to) use them and protect them. From time to time I also write programs, like when building tools or automating tasks.

In order to understand and create programs you have to know a programming language's constructs (their syntax and semantics), libraries and the idiomatic way of using them. In other words you need to learn to program well in your language of choice. But how if you don't get to program every day?

There's a similar situation in martial arts. You don't want to be discovering and learning fighting techniques in a fight. Martial arts' solution is called kata. It's a set of fighting techniques that are regularly practiced until internalized. [Gokatas](https://github.com/gokatas) is my implementation of this idea for Go programming.

The get started install the gokatas command line tool:

```
go install github.com/gokatas/gokatas@latest
```

One practice cycle looks like this:

1. Choose a kata and clone it. By default katas are shown in alphabetical order but you can sort them by size.

```
‚ùØ gokatas -sortby lines -wide
Name       Lines  Done  Last done    URL                                       Description                      Standard library packages

‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/gokatas/bcounter.git
Cloning into 'bcounter'...
‚ùØ cd bcounter
```

2. Read the documentation and code and try to understand it. You can use ChatGPT to help you out.

```
‚ùØ  export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
‚ùØ gokatas -explain bcounter
# Code Explanation:

The `Bcounter` type is implemented as a type that counts bytes before discarding them. It satisfies the `io.Writer` interface, allowing it to be passed to `fmt.Fprint`.

The `bcounter` type is defined as an integer type.

The `Write` method of the `bcounter` type takes a byte slice `p` as input, updates the counter by adding the length of the byte slice, and returns the length of the byte slice and a `nil` error.

In the `main` function, a variable `b` of type `bcounter` is declared. The `fmt.Fprint` function writes the string "hello" to `b`. Then, the `Write` method is called with the byte slice containing "world". Finally, the value of `b` is printed to the console.
```

3. Delete (some of) the code and try to write it back. Check how are you doing.

```
git diff
```

4. Track your progress to stay motivated.

```
gokatas -done bcounter
```

It's important to practice regularly because repetition creates habits, and habits are what enable mastery. Set a goal that you are able to meet and insert it into your daily routines. Start by taking baby steps. After some time it will require much less will power to practice. Your programming moves will start looking simpler and smoother. ü•ã
