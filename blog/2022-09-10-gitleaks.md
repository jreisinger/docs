I keep most of my code and prose on public GitHub. I do it because I get reliable and easily accessible storage for free. Other reasons are that it engages my [hubris](https://thethreevirtues.com/) and it might be helpful to others.

It's working nicely but sometimes I get a bad feeling when I push stuff. I'm worried that I might push some sensitive information like passwords, API keys or tokens. The obvious solution is to think twice before committing and pushing data.

But there's also a helpful tool called [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks). It finds and reports secrets in your existing commits or in the files you are about to commit. I want to run it whenever I commit something in any of my repos. These are the steps to make it happen:

1. Install [gileaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks):

```
brew install gitleaks
```

2. Add `hooksPath` to [.gitconfig](https://github.com/jreisinger/HOME/blob/main/.gitconfig):

```
[core]
        hooksPath = ~/.git-global-hooks
```

3) Create [pre-commit](https://github.com/jreisinger/HOME/blob/main/.git-global-hooks/pre-commit) hook in ~/.git-global-hooks:

```
#!/bin/sh
set -x

# detect secrets
gitleaks detect -v  # in existing git commits
gitleaks protect -v # in files before they are committed
```
