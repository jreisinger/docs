I keep most of my code and prose on public GitHub. I do it because I get reliable and easily accessible storage for free. Other reasons are that it engages my [hubris](https://thethreevirtues.com/) and it might be helpful to others.

It's working nicely but sometimes I get a bad feeling when I push stuff. I'm worried that I might leak some sensitive information like passwords, API keys or tokens. The obvious solution is to think twice before committing and pushing data.

But there are also some helpful tools, like 

* [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)
* [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) by AWS people

They basically find and report secrets in your existing commits or in the files you are about to commit. I want to run them whenever I commit something in *any* of my repos. These are the steps to make that happen:

1. Install the tools.
2. Add `hooksPath = ~/.git-global-hooks` to [.gitconfig](https://github.com/jreisinger/HOME/blob/main/.gitconfig).
3. Create [pre-commit](https://github.com/jreisinger/HOME/blob/main/.git-global-hooks/pre-commit) hook in `~/.git-global-hooks`.
