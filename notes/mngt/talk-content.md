1. Write down all sub-topics that you *could* talk about within the given topic.
2. Mark all topics that are not that important until only five most imporant remain. These will be your chapters.
3. Find a story that connects those five chapters. If a chapter doesn't fit the story swap it with a less important topic.
4. Classify the remaining topics under one of those five chapters or throw out. You'll throw out most of them.
5. You want to end up with 5 topics under each of the 5 chapters.
6. Create super-simple slides. One slide == one message. Slides != handouts.

NOTE: you are going to need 10-20 hours of preparation for an hour of talk.
