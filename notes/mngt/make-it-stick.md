Principles

* all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge [1]
* when you do mechanical repeating you quickly hit the limit of what you can keep in your mind
* when you practice elaboration [2] there are not known limits

Practical hints

* recall facts and concepts from memory over re-reading
* try to solve a problem (often with errors) before being taught the solution
* use different learning styles, e.g. auditory vs visual
* use testing to identify weaknesses

[1]: e.g. you need to remember algebra and geometry before you can learn trigonometry
[2]: elaboration = expressing new material in your own words and connecting it with what you already know
