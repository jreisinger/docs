What is work

- original contribution to the world, without starving

How much am I supposed to like what I do

- unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching
- *upper bound* 
    - it's not what you would like to do this second
    - you need to consider some longer period, like a week or a month
- *lower bound* 
    - you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure
- if your work is not your favorite thing to do
    - terrible problems with procrastination
    - you'll have to force yourself to work -> distinctly inferior results
- you need to do something you not only *enjoy*, but *admire*
- you have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool
- test: do things that would make your friends say wow (hubris)

How to find it

- you don't need discipline doing the work you like but you need discipline to find it
- avoid being guided by prestige and money
- *try to do a good job* at whatever you're doing, even if you don't like it
    - at least you won't use dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy
    - you'll get into the habit of doing things well
- *always produce*
    - this approach will push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, towards things you actually like
- keep separated the ideas about what you want and what seems to be possible
