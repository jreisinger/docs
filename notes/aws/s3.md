By default, when an S3 resource (bucket or object) is created or uploaded, the AWS account becomes its owner.

When an AWS account uploads (an object) within a bucket owned by a different account, the uploader account becomes the resource owner.

To manage access use identity-based policy (IAM) or resource-based policy (bucket policy or ACL).

Why IAM policies
* central mngt. in one place
* 1 or 2 policies across many buckets rather than 1 policy per bucket
* can control access for more than one service at a time

Why bucket policies
* apply to a bucket and its objects
* you maintain security policies within S3 alone
* can grant cross-account access without having to create (within IAM) and assume roles

```json
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        "Sid":"Example bucket policy",
        "Effect":"Allow",
        "Principal":{
            "AWS":"arn:aws:iam:012345678912:root"
        },
        "Action":[
            "s3:*"
        ],
        "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::myS3bucket"
        ]
    ]
}
```

Why ACLs
* you can set permissions per object
* less granular (not a JSON), no implicit deny, no conditions

CORS
* allows specific resources on a web page to be requested from a different domain than its own
* this allows you to build client-side web apps that can access resources stored in S3
