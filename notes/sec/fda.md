Cybersecurity in Medical Devices (FDA .pdf from 2023)

I. Introduction

- medical devices become increasingly connected via network and portable media
- there's frequent electronic exchange of health information
- cybersecurity threats to the healthcare sector have become more frequent and more severe
- cybersecurity incidents may lead to patient harm as a result of delay in diagnoses and/or treatment
- FDA guidance documents are recommendations

III. Background

- the term "medical device system" includes the device and systems - such as healthcare facility networks, other devices, and software update servers - to which it is connected 

IV. General Principles

B. Designing for Security

Security objectives:

- Authenticity, which includes integrity (I)
- Authorization
- Availability (A)
- Confidentiality (C)
- Secure and timely updatability and patchability

Appendix 1.

F. Event Detection and Logging

- critical capabilities that should be present in a device and the larger system in which it operates
- to identify and track suspected and successful attempts to compromise a medical device
- should include storage capabilities, if possible, so that forensic discovery maybe later be performed
