Quantum computing (as of 2020)

* began in 1980s
* operates on principles of quantum physics rather than the limitations of
  circuits and electricity
* it could one day achieve things that classical computing can't
* it has the potential to unravel [rozmota≈•] decades of work put into crypto
  algorithms and standards we use today
* everything that's encrypted with today's PK crypto can be decrypted with
  tomorrow's quantum computers
* it might take 10 to 15 years

Bottom line: we need to work on post-quantum security.
