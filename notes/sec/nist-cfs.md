These notes are from the Initial Public Draft of The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 as of December 2023.

CSF
- cybersec risks are fundamental type of risk for all organizations to manage
- potential impacts
    - higher costs
    - lower revenue
    - reputational damage
    - impairment of innovation
    - loss of individuals' privacy
    - loss of access to essential services
    - the last two points can result in life-or-death consequences
- guidance to help understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate about risks and actions that will reduce them
- those actions are intended to address outcomes described within the CSF Core
- Profiles and Tiers help put CSF into practice

Orgs will continue to have different
- threats
- vulnerabilities
- risk tolerance
- mission objectives
- requirements across sectors

CSF Core
- Informative References
- Implementation Examples
Profile (posture)
- mechanism for describing an organization's current and/or target cybersec posture in terms of the Core's outcomes
Tiers
- characterize the rigor of an organization's cybersecurity risk governance and management outcomes

CSF can be used in numerous ways depending on
- stakeholder expectations
- risk appetite and tolerance
- budget
