Don't forget the *overall goal*: delivering reasonable security for users and customers.

1) Enemy knowledge or action against you
* vulnerability externally discovered
* vulnerability under active attack
* how: specific threat intelligence

2) Missing security capability at attack surface
* we can't protect/detect/respond to an attack here
* how: focus on detect (observability, visibility) and attack surface defenses

3) Company-level risk
* we have highly sensitive data (asset) that is not properly secured
* how: chapter and verse of a standard or a clear pentest result

Other battles will be hard to win and you'll spend energy for less reward.
