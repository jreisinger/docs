DevOps teams help engineering organizations 

- automate tasks
- build tools
- improve CI/CD process
- topple silos

DevOps teams write

- small scripts
- CLI tools
- complex automation
- complex services

Go has benefits for all of the above situations

- fast build and startup time make you efficient
- relative ease to understand and learn helps with engineers turnover
- extensive standard library (http, io, time, regexp, os/exec, encoding/json) allows you to get right into business logic 
- static type system and explicit error handling make even small scripts more robust

All of the above put you in great position when your "one-time use" script gets larger.
