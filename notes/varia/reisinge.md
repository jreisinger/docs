`reisinge` was my first Unix login at [university](https://euba.sk).

Curiously, according to [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reisinge),
it's also a word coming from middle English. It's an aternative form for
`reysynge`. And reysynge comes from `reysen` which means

1. To enter in service for a foreign military compaign.
2. To go on a journey or trip.
