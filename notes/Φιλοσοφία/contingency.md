Leibniz said that the first question which should rightly be asked is: "Why is there something rather than nothing?"

Leibniz' Contingency Argument

1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its nature `*` , or in an external cause `**`.
2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God `***`.
3. The universe exists.
4. The explanation of the universe's existence is God.

`*` It's impossible for it not to exist. Abstract objects, like numbers or sets, probably exist like this.

`**` It's caused to exist by something else, it doesn't have to exist. Most of the things we are familiar with exist like this. If your parents had never met you wouldn't exist. There is no reason to think that the world around us (the space-time reality) had to exist. If the universe might not have existed, why does it exist. 

`***` God = the extremely powerful, uncaused, necessarily existing, non-contingent, non-physical, immaterial, eternal being, who created the entire universe and everything in it.
