Jewish story told by Martin Buber (taken from Ratzinger's Introduction to Christianity):

An adherent of the Enlightenment, a very learned man, who had heard of the Rabbi
of Berditchev, paid a visit to him in order to argue, as was his custom, with
him, too, and to shatter his old-fashioned proofs of the truth of his faith.
When he entered the Rabbi's room, he found him walking up and down with a book
in his hand, rapt in thought. The Rabbi paid no attention to the new arrival.
Suddenly he stopped, looked at him fleetingly, and said, "But perhaps it is
true after all." The scholar tried in vain to collect himself - his knees
trembled, so terrible was the Rabbi to behold and so terrible his simple
utterance to hear. But Rabbi Levi Yitschak now turned to face him and spoke
quite calmly: "My son, the great scholars of the Torah with whom you have
argued wasted their words on you; as you departed you laughed at them. They
were unable to lay God and his Kingdom on the table before you, and neither can
I. But think, my son, perhaps it is true." The exponent of the Enlightenment
opposed him with all his strength; but this terrible "perhaps" that echoed back
at him  time after time broke his resistance.
