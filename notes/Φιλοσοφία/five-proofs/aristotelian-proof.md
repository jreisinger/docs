# Change occurs

Coffee in a cup gets cold (qualitative).

Leave falls of the three (location).

A puddle grows larger (quantitative).

A fly dies (substantial).

# The Matrix or Descartes' Meditations

What if our entire life is a dream or hallucination?

You still have one experience or thought, then another. That is a kind of change.

---

# Parmenides

Change is illusion.

Coldness of a coffee does not exist when coffee is hot. It comes to existence.

But something can't come from nothing.

---

# Aristotle

Coldness is not *actually* present but it's present *potentially* in a way other qualities are not.

Change = actualization of potential.

---

# How does change occur?

Usually a change requires a cause.

It's not the coffee that makes itself cold. It's the surrounding air. The air had a potential to be cold.

More technically (and precisely): some potentials are actualized, and when they are, there must be something already actual which actualizes them.

# Types of change

Sometimes we have a series of changers and things changed.

* Linear series (like the coffee example or a family tree) - can extend to infinity.
* Hierarchical series - must have a first member.

---

# Hierarchical series

* think of something existing in a single moment (not essential but useful to introduce the idea): coffee on table 
* why is this change? change is actualization of potential
* the potential of the cup to be three feet off the ground it actualized by the desk, the potential of the desk to hold cup aloft is actualized by the floor, ...
* there is *dependency* of later members on the earlier ones
* every later member has only derivative or instrumental (paintbrush vs painter) causal power

---

# First cause 

* there must be something that has the power to hold up the intermediaries w/o being held up itself
* technically: things that have only a derivative power must derive it from something that has it "built-in" => first cause (not in a temporal sense)
* more fundamental than linear series because linear series presuppose hierarchical series

---

# Existence

* so a coffee can get cold or be on a table it must first exist
* existence of a thing is also an actualization of potential
* existence of coffee is actualized by existence of water => atoms => subatomic particles, ...
* this is a hierarchical series -> must have a first member

---

# Unmoved Mover

* since we are talking about existence -> this first member must be able to actualize the potential for other things to exist without having to have its own existence actualized by anything
* this first member doesn't have any potential for existence that needs to be actualized, it's just actual, always and already actual => it doesn't *have* actuality like things it actualized do but it *is* pure actuality itself
* this first member = uncaused cause = unmoved mover (Aristotle) = unactualized actualizer

---

# Universality of this conclusion

* what is true of the coffee is true of any material thing as well
* the undeniable reality of change entails the existence of Unmoved Mover

---

# Unmoved Mover = God?

* the ultimate cause of existence of all things - keeps all things in being from moment to moment
* immutable - pure actuality devoid of potentiality
* eternal - existence within time entails changeability
* immaterial - material entails being changeable and existing within time
* perfect - imperfection is failure to realize some potential (an injured animal or damaged plant)
* one - there can be two or more of a kind if there is something to differentiate them
* omnipotent (power - capacity to make something happen, to actualize a potential)
* fully good (thing is good to the extent it realizes its potentials, e.g. good vs bad painter)

# Is it somehow personal, like intelligent?

Intelligence

a) capacity to grasp abstract concepts (e.g. man, mortal)
b) put these concepts together into complete thoughts (e.g. all man are mortal)
c) capacity to infer one though from others (e.g. Socrates is a man => Socrates is mortal)

---

# Abstract concepts

a) is the most basic or fundamental of these three

* to grasp a concept = have the same form or pattern in mind that exists in the things you think about
* all men or all triangles have some pattern that makes them the same thing
* when these patterns come to exist in material things, we have various individual objects - men or triangles
* when we think of men or triangles we abstract away all the particular men and triangles and focus on what is common or universal to them
* this is the essence of intellectual activity - the capacity to have universal or abstract form or pattern of a thing without being that kind of thing
* you can contemplate what it is to be a triangle, you have that pattern of being triangle, without being a triangle

---

# Principle of proportionate causality

* whatever is in some effect must in *some* way be in the cause
* when I cause you to have $20 I must have them formally (e.g. in my wallet) or virtually (e.g. able to borrow from someone else) or eminently (e.g. make Congress to grant me the power to manufacture $20 bills)

* Unmoved Mover is the cause of existence of all things
* to cause something to exist = cause something to have certain form or fitting a certain pattern
* all forms/patterns must exist in Unmoved Mover in completely universal or abstract way => fundamental capacity of intelligence
* similar to the things we make preexists as ideas or plans in our minds
