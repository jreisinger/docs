# Basic logic

* is common sense, Aristotelian logic
* Aristotle (4 c. B.C.) was a student of Plato who was a student of Socrates

## Logical expressions

[Term](https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~filit/fvt/termin.html) (understanding): the
subject [predmet] or predicate [pr√≠sudok] of a proposition, expressing a concept

* clear (unambiguous)
* unclear (ambiguous)

[Proposition](https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~filit/fvv/vyrok.html) (judging):
declarative sentence, affirmative or negative

* true
    * evident
        * self-evident
            * in itself and to us
            * in itself but not to us
        * through other propositions
            * deductively - from a general principle to an instance of it
            * inductively - from individual cases to general principles
    * not evident
* false

[Argument](https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~filit/fvd/dokaz.html) (reasoning): a proof
that a certain proposition is true by showing that it follows (logically and
necessarily - what cannot be otherwise) from other propositions being true

* logically valid
* logically invalid

## Syllogism

is basic form of deductive argument, e.g.:

1. Rational animals are mortal. - major proposition
2. Socrates is a rational animal. - minor proposition
3. Therefore Socrates is mortal. - conclusion

Syllogism connects the subject (Socrates) and predicate terms (mortal) of
its conclusion through its middle term (rational animal) in its two
propositions. The first of which states a general principle and the second
brings a particular case under that principle. The conclusion then demonstrates
the result of applying the general principle to the particular case.

If you are a programmer you might find [this code](https://github.com/jreisinger/syllogism) useful.
