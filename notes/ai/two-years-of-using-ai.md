Notes from https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/two-years-of-using-ai

Chatting with the Codebase
- I found it very useful to be able to **ask questions** like “where is validation of X implemented”, or “how are we filtering?”.
- added value over text search

Model evolution
- A “TL/DR” summary of where model evolution is at this point, is that while there are multiple good candidates out there, Anthropic's **Claude Sonnet** series has clearly emerged as a consistent favorite for coding tasks. It’s my "sensible default" recommendation, as of today.

Cognitive shift: mental model of the AI teammate
Here’s the persona I settled on for AI assistants:
- Eager to help
- Stubborn, and sometimes with a short-term memory
- Very well-read, but inexperienced
- Overconfident

Beware biases
- **over-trusting the system**
- confident phrasing of LLM responses, a particular approach is "best practice"
- The anchoring effect +/-
- **sunk cost fallacy**

General ways of working principles
- Reflect on feedback loops
- Know when to **quit**
- Know your context providers and integrated tools

Emerging workflows with agents
- Use custom instructions.
- Plan (with AI) first.
- Keep tasks small.
- Be concrete.
- Use some form of memory.
