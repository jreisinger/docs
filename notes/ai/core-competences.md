1. really good summarizer
2. good at explaining things, teaching with infinite patience
3. can persuade (propaganda is an offshoot of this)
4. fundamentally a prediction technology
	1. about whether turning left or right will get you to your destination faster
	2. about whether a tumor is cancerous (might improve medical diagnoses)
	3. about which word is likely to come next (can help compose an email)
5. can assess (a decision is a prediction plus an assessment)

How these competences translate to actual useful AI systems depends a lot on the details. We donâ€™t know how far AI will go in replicating or replacing human cognitive functions. Or how soon that will happen.
