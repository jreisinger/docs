## About this

Welcome to my homepage, friend. I mostly keep technical notes here.

## About me

I try to understand and navigate the tar pits of computing :-). Some of my preferred technologies nowadays are Go and Kubernetes. Before I concentrated on Perl and Linux. See my [CV](cv.md) and [links](links.md) for more.
